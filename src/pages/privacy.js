#### Last Updated and Effective Date: July 16, 2020
We at **ZMS Education & Technology**, *(hereinafter referred to as "ZMS")* have created this Privacy Policy to describe our practices globally regarding information we collect through our websites, mobile features, applications and any other interactive features or services owned or controlled by ZMS that post a link to this Privacy Policy *(each, a "Service" and collectively, the "Services")*, as well as any information we collect offline and combine in our databases.
Certain features discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on each Service at any particular time or may not be available in certain regions.
Note that we combine the information we collect through all of our websites, mobile applications, and other Services.
**Note about Children:** Our Services are general-audience in nature and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13.
## SCOPE
This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us in our business globally through our Services.
## I. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you are a customer, user, applicant or visitor, and the requirements of applicable law.
## Information You Provide to Us.
**Account Creation:** When you create a user account, we collect your name, email address, username, and password and we may ask you to optionally provide demographic or other information such as your school, gender, age or birthdate, zip code, and information about your interests and preferences.
**Profile Creation:** You may have the opportunity to create a profile which may include photographs, information about your academic and work history, and your interests and activities.
**Registration to become a ZMS Tutor:** When you register to be a ZMS Tutor, we will collect information from you such as your education and employment history, phone number, photo, country of residence, and information we need to process payments to you, such as your bank account information, social security number, or taxpayer identification number, as necessary to facilitate payment and to comply with related legal obligations.
**Your Communications with Us.** We collect personal information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter or loyalty program, request customer or technical support, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.
**Communications with Others on Our Platforms.** The Services may allow community members to communicate and collaborate with each other, including some Services that allow community members to engage in one-on-one communication using a video chat or text chat feature. Our servers may record, and we may retain records of the content of any such user-to-user communications.
**Payment and Financial Information.** We will process your payment information if you purchase products or services through our Services. Note that we do not store payment credit or debit card numbers.
